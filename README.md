# The Impact of Psychometric Factors on Employee Attrition
## Introduction

The Human Resources Function has changed.  Beginning in the previous century, HR functioned as an administrative center, focusing on the management of pesonnel recruiting, onboarding, compensation and termination of employees.  

During the 1970's, companies began to face a more competitive climate fostered by increased globalization, technologial innovation and business deregulation.  In such a competiatve climate there was a greater awareness of how attracting the right employees and retaining them, substantially impacts performance.  Beginning in the early years of the 20th century, there was an increased awareness that HR must substantially change from viewing employees not just as a major cost (which of course they are); but as a generator of revenue for which greater investment was crucial.  In order to realize harness the potential of Human Capital, It was seen that HR lagged other business areas such as marketing and finance in the adaptation of data analysis as well as data modeling for the purposes of prediction and classifiction. These are areas that I am very much interested in studying and to which this project is addresed.

Taking one problem, this project began as an effort to study employee data with an eye to determining whether we may predict employee attrition from Psychometric characteristics.  This project was complicated by the fact that generally speaking, employee data is confidential.  As such, the only I way I could proceed was to employ a realistic looking but manufactered data set.  

I found such a set in IBM's Developer's page for Data Science. They made a set of employee data freely available for study purposed on Kaggle. 

The data utilized is for study purposes only: the initial set of data was fabricated by IBM for the purposes of providing data for understanding and practicing data science tools & techniques. To this I supplemented actual psychometric data that come from online personality tests. For the purposes of the project, I imagined that the psychometric exams were administered to the employees. In such a fabricated scenario it is unrealistic to suggest that any "TRUE" insights may be derived but nonethless, will provide sufficiently complex data for a machine learning study.

However, I was interested in what role psychometrics would play in relation to employees. It is possible to gather psychometric data from potential employees and I wanted to see what sort of infomration could be gathered by using psychometric data to complement the employee data. So for the purpsoses of study, I found an independent set of psychmetric data that enabled me to study patterns of behavior by modeling them. While I will not be able to make preditions based on this data, it nonethlesss affords an opportunity for study.
